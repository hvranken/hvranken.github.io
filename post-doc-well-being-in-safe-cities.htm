<h3>Postdoc position</h3>
<p>The Open University of the Netherlands (OUNL) is offering a postdoc-position for six months as part of an interdisciplinary research project between computer science and psychology. The research project aims at improving the well-being of people living in urban environments. The research approach consists of:
<ol>
<li>measuring data in urban environments,</li>
<li>analysing these data and relating them to the well-being of individuals and communities, and</li>
<li>using the results for developing innovative solutions (e.g., policies or concrete measures) that improve well-being.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>In this interdisciplinary research project, computer science contributes IT-technology for data measurement and data analysis, while psychology contributes social and behavioural aspects of individuals and communities and steers the selection and application of IT-technology. The project offers a splendid opportunity to do interdisciplinary research with strong valorisation and practical relevance. The project is funded by the OUNL research programme DALI (Digital Accessible Learning Innovation), theme ‘Safety in urban environments’.</p>

<br><p><b><i>Project description</i></b></br>
<p>The project includes two subprojects.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the first subproject, we will apply Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for data collection. In urban environments, sensors may for instance be attached to lampposts or buildings at street corners. These sensors can monitor and record physical conditions of the environment (such as temperature, wind, air pollution, sound, light, humidity, vibrations, traffic) as well as behavioural data (such the presence of cigarette smoke, speed at which people walk by, emotional levels of conversations) in the direct surroundings of people, and transmit these data via a wireless network to a central server for further processing. Such data gathering can be fully anonymous. Next to data gathered by sensors, additional data can be obtained from questionnaires/surveys and public databases.</li>

<li>In the second subproject, data gathered with an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) app and data gathered with the GPS-smartphone function will be combined. EMA is an intensive longitudinal research methodology asking participants to report on their thoughts, feelings, behaviours, and/or environment on multiple occasions over time. Combing these data with GPS-data is known as Geographically explicit Ecological Momentary Assessment (GEMA), which studies the interplay between individuals’ experience and their evolving environmental surroundings by measuring mental health and well-being related to geographical and temporal characteristics.</li>
</ol>

<p>The tasks of the postdoc are in both subprojects to contribute innovative ideas and to do a small-scale feasibility study. The postdoc publishes the research results and prepares a research proposal for follow-up research, preferably by applying for external funding.</p>

<br><p><b><i>Requirements</i></b>
<ul>
<li>A (finished or nearly finished) PhD degree in a subject area related to computer science with strong affinity to psychology (or vice versa: A (finished or nearly finished) PhD degree in psychology with strong affinity to computer science)</li>
<li>Preferably practical experience with Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), app development, and Geographically explicit Ecological Momentary Assessment (GEMA)</li>
<li>Creativity, self-management skills and cooperation skills</li>
<li>Excellent academic writing and presentation skills</li>
</ul>
